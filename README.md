# SmartSolarDevice
A project for the CoDevelop/ team

## Function of the Hardware
This hardware has the have the ability to:
* determine the temperature of the water on the roof (solar panels)
* determine the tempurature of the hot water cylinder at both the inlet and outlet (top and bottom)
* switch on the water pump to cycle hot water from the roof panels to the cylinder
* switch on the power to the hot water cylinder element (*not* directly power the element)
* have onboard visual feedback when the pump or element is on
* allow for direct access to basic functions of the device

## Hardware
OK, the following is a list of hardware I'm using (so far).
* [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)
* more to come

## Basic Prototype Layout
